This section is just for a beginner angularJS developer (note that a beginner angular developer is mean
who is the senior font-end developer, and understand object oriented in javascript).
You can search 'object oriented in javascript' on the internet and you also get more information, or
just follow object oriented by me (at my older post for object oriented in javascript).

In next section I will show angularJS skill just for profession developer.

Note:   + AngularJS is easy way to learn and easy way to code than Jquery.
        + In this course I've just cover a course, which is a course if you want to
          learn in normal way you must pay so much money for it. And I don't want to
          show that course because if I do that I will be a bad guy with the author.
