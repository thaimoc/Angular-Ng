This section is just for expert developer so I don't want to show them.
Because if you want to learn them you will add so more font-end developer skills
like expressJS, requiredJS, bowerJs, unit test in angular,... Therefore you can search
them on the internets.

In next section I will show angularJS skill just for profession developer.

Note:   + AngularJS is easy way to learn and easy way to code than Jquery.
        + In this course I've just cover a course, which is a course if you want to
          learn in normal way you must pay so much money for it. And I don't want to
          show that course because if I do that I will be a bad guy with the author.
